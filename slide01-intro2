# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

# Performance Implications
#   Parallelism
#   Concurrence
#     No semaphores
#     No monitors
#     No locks
#     No race-conditions
#     No Deadlocks
#   Garbage Collection
#     Each process has its own heap
#     The data in your application is divvied up between these processes
#     Each individual heap is much, much smaller
#     As a result, garbage collection runs faster
