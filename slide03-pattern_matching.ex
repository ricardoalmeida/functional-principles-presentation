IO.puts a = 1
IO.puts 1 = a
IO.puts 2 = a
# IO.puts a = 2
# IO.puts ^a = 1

# [a, b] = [1, 2]
# [a, a] = [1, 2]

# Elixir’s pattern matching is similar to Erlang’s
# (the main difference being that Elixir allows a match
# to assign to a variable that was assigned in a prior match,
# whereas in Erlang a variable can be assigned only once).
